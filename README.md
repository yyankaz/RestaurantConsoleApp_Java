# Console App for Restaurant (Menu System, Customer Database, Bill Counter, etc.)
A small **java** console project. 

This is an app for restaurant clients, which should:
- demonstrate the menu by sections, with the possibility to choose an interested section and view its list of dishes;
- display a short description of each dish with all necessary information;
- have a special section with all available discounts/promotions/gifts â€” this information should be separated into another menu section;
- provide a "Client Manager" that stores customer data: first and last names, contact details, status level, etc.;
- offer the possibility to browse the menu and dishes, add a dish to the shopping cart, and remove it from there;
- include a final-step bill counter that combines all the above points: sums prices, applies discounts and promotions, reads the payment amount from the customer, and calculates the change.

Because the project is simple, small, console-based, and focused on learning, it will be implemented using basic Java tools without any additional frameworks.

Main Java tools, used in this project:
- algorithms and OOP;
- `enum` data type;
- inheritance;
- formatted output using ANSI;
- collections(`List`, `Map`);
- exception handling(`try-catch`);
- user input via `Scanner`;
